    <h3>What is a Mood Tracker?</h3>
    <p>
      A mood tracker is a tool used to log your moods as they change. Keeping track of your mood can help you understand what is triggering mood changes in your environment, or how different situations impact you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mood tracking can be especially helpful if you have particular mental health conditions, like depression or anxiety, to label and regulate moods as they arise. Mood tracking can also be beneficial if you don’t have a mental health condition, so you can better understand yourself and your emotions.
